Intruder Alarm
This is a simple home automation project with a number of door sensors (tamber and alarm status), PIR devices with alerts given via a sounder. Alerts of change of status will be sent to the user via email or other communications available from Wia. Photos are taken via a camera when the system is activated and the intruder alarm is triggered.

The door sensors and PIR will be added via GPIO to a raspberry PI along with LEDs to show that the system is set etc.

The setting of the Intruder alarm will be completed via a web app as I intend on using node.js for this project.

The intruder system will have LEDs for the status of the system (GPIO) 

From a data perspective I intend using Wia.io as MQTT broker.

Automation
For lighting in the shed I would use a 5V/240V relay to trigger a light via a web app. I may even use a wireless light for this. As I have a 4 relay board I might time permitting add other functionality to the system such as some kind of heater if the temperature drops too much.

Temperature measurement in the shed will be taken via GY-BME280 device. Alerts will be sent if the temperature/humdity go under a certain range so as any sensitive equipment in the shed can be removed.

I will be logging all the data from the Intruder Alarm and Automation in a database for further interrigation
